## Implementation Guidelines

### Daily Routine
1. **Morning Review**: Check all open positions for profit-taking opportunities
2. **Market Assessment**: Evaluate VIX level and volatility regime  
3. **Position Entry**: Open new positions if weekly goals not met
4. **Risk Monitoring**: Ensure position sizes within account limits
5. **Early Closing**: Close positions at 70%+ profit (don't get greedy)

### Entry Timing
- **Preferred Window**: 10:10-10:30 AM (after morning volatility settles)
- **Avoid**: First 10 minutes (gap volatility) and last 30 minutes (MOC flows)
- **Market Days Only**: No weekend gap risk

### Position Management
- **Monitor Daily**: Don't set-and-forget
- **Close Early**: 70-90% profit target (modeled at 70%)
- **Don't Hold to Expiration**: Time decay accelerates but assignment risk increases
- **Roll Strategically**: Close current position, wait for better entry on new position

### Regime Adjustments

#### Normal Volatility (VIX 15-25)
- **Put Spreads**: 15 delta, full position size
- **Covered Calls**: 12 delta, normal size
- **Standard execution**

#### High Volatility (VIX >25)  
- **Put Spreads**: 12 delta (more conservative)
- **Covered Calls**: 10 delta (reduce assignment risk)
- **Consider smaller sizes until volatility normalizes**

#### Low Volatility (VIX <15)
- **Put Spreads**: 18 delta (slightly more aggressive)
- **Covered Calls**: 15 delta (higher premium)
- **Monitor for volatility expansion**

## Key Success Factors

### 1. Disciplined Early Closing
- **Don't get greedy**: 70-80% profit is excellent
- **Time decay vs Assignment risk**: Better to close early than risk assignment
- **Compound effect**: Faster turnover = more opportunities

### 2. Consistent Execution  
- **Daily routine**: Make it systematic, not discretionary
- **Position sizing**: Scale appropriately to account size
- **No market timing**: Consistent weekly entries regardless of market direction

### 3. Conservative Delta Management
- **15 delta puts**: High probability of profit (85%+ theoretical)
- **12 delta calls**: Low assignment risk while collecting decent premium
- **Regime awareness**: Adjust for volatility environment

### 4. Proper Capital Allocation
- **Account sizing**: Don't over-leverage
- **Reserve cash**: Keep 10-15% for opportunities/margin calls
- **Scale gradually**: Start small and increase size as confidence builds

## Risk Considerations

### Strategy Risks
- **Assignment Risk**: Covered calls if stock gaps up significantly
- **Volatility Expansion**: Put spreads under pressure in market crashes
- **Liquidity Risk**: SOFI options may have wider spreads during stress
- **Concentration Risk**: Single stock exposure

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Early closing**: Reduces assignment and volatility expansion risk
- **Conservative deltas**: High probability positions
- **Position sizing**: Never risk more than account can handle
- **Diversification**: Consider applying to multiple underlyings over time

## Performance Expectations

### Realistic Targets (Properly Scaled)
- **Monthly Income**: 1-2% of account value
- **Annual Return**: 12-24% (options premium)
- **Win Rate**: 80-90% with disciplined early closing
- **Max Drawdown**: 5-10% in stressed markets

### Conservative Targets (Risk-Averse)
- **Monthly Income**: 0.5-1% of account value  
- **Annual Return**: 6-12%
- **Win Rate**: 85-95%
- **Max Drawdown**: 3-5%
